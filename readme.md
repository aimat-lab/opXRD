## About

Python API for opXRD database. See more under https://xrd.aimat.science

## Setup

### System level requirements
The data file import functionalities provided by the xrdpattern requirement are largely built on the C++ library  [xylib](https://github.com/wojdyr/xylib) so beyond a standard python install this library also requires:
- A C++ compiler and standard library
- A C++ to python bridge (Swig)
```
sudo apt install build-essential	# GNU C++ compiler
sudo apt install libboost-all-dev       # C++ libraries provided by Boost
sudo apt install swig 			# python -> C++ bridge
```

For Windows >10 you may try the following in PowerShell (requires [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)):
```
choco install mingw  # C++ compiler and std library
choco install swig   # python -> C++ bridge
```

### Python library
Once the system level requirements are installed, the library can be installed using pip:
```
pip install opxrd
```
